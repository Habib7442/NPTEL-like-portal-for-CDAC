            <h4>NPTEL MOOCs</h4>
            <p>NPTEL began offering open online courses in March 2014. It is now 
                possible for ANYONE outside the IIT System to<br> be able to do an online 
                certification course from NPTEL and get a certificate from the IITs. 
                IITs are reaching out and<br> taking education to the homes of people 
                through this initiative.</p>

            <h4>Why was this initiative through the model of Open Online Courses?</h4>
            <p>Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) is essentially an asynchronous 
                teaching-learning platform, where the<br> process involves use of 
                pre-recorded lectures, resource video materials, lecture notes, 
                assignments and quizzes,<br> as content and self assessment at regular 
                intervals. The learning, through scheduling of fixed time duration 
                for<br> completion of courses and, therefore, the simultaneous participation 
                of teachers and a large number of students<br> may be termed synchronous 
                and is thus similar to a classroom, albeit on the Internet and being 
                much larger in size.<br> When offered with consideration for students in 
                non-urban and rural areas through supplementary DVDs and<br> mobile 
                delivered content, they enable quality and equitable access to a 
                much larger population of students and can<br> lead to a significant rise 
                in the Gross Enrollment Ratio. These courses are open for anyone to 
                access – free of cost.<br> So anyone who is interested in learning gets 
                access to quality content, which also includes discussion with the<br> 
                course faculty and access to assignments for self testing. The faculty 
                who are currently offering courses are from<br> the IITs or from other 
                reputed institutes such as CMI, IMSc etc.</p>

          <h4>NPTEL Online Certification</h4>
          <p>The objective of enabling students obtain certificates for courses is to 
            make students employable in the industry or<br> pursue a suitable higher 
            education programme. Through an online portal, 4, 8, or 12-week online 
            courses, typically<br> on topics relevant to students in all years of higher 
            education along with basic core courses in sciences and<br> humanities with 
            exposure to relevant tools and technologies, are being offered. Enrolment 
            to and learning from these courses is free. Following these online courses, 
            an in-person, proctored certification exam is conducted and<br> a certificate 
            is provided through the participating institutions and industry, as 
            applicable.<br><br>Some statistics regarding the open online courses since March 2014 till Dec 2021</p>

            <ul>

        <div class="container">
          <h4>Certification process</h4>
          <p>NPTEL began the initiative of offering certification to students for courses in March 2014. The<br> process of certification is as follows.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Subject Matter Experts (SME - faculty from IITs or partner institutes with input from industry)<br> create recorded video content for courses.</li>
            <li>The course is uploaded on the portal and opened for enrollments, which is free.</li>
            <li>Every week, about 3 hrs of video content is released along with an assignment , which is<br> evaluated and provides the student with a score.</li>
            <li>Teaching Assistants (TAs) and the faculty members support the discussion forum –<br> answering questions and clearing doubts.</li>
            <li>If someone wants to get a certificate from the IITs/IISc after doing 
              the course, he/she should<br> register for the in-person proctored 
              certification exam that is conducted in 170+ cities across<br> India and 
              in select cities outside India too in collaboration with an exam partner. 
              For learners<br> in many other countries looking to get certified, online 
              remote proctored exams are also<br> administered. The certification exam is
              not free but has a nominal fee of Rs 1000.</li>
            <li>A learner will pass and be certified only if Average assignment score 
              (out of 100) >= 40 AND<br> Final exam score ( out of 100) >= 40. E-verifiable 
              certificates are made available inside the<br> candidate login. Only 
              e-certificates will be published. Hard copies of certificates will NOT 
              be<br> printed. The pass criteria depends on the courses. The above mentioned 
              is applicable for<br> most of the courses but for those courses which have 
              non proctored programming exams<br> and for courses in other disciplines, 
              the pass criteria may be different.</li>
            <li>These certificates are envisioned for use in credit transfer to universities or for making the<br> student more employable or for enhancing their growth in their current place of work.</li>

          <h4>Why should a learner do NPTEL online certification courses?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Enables the student to directly engage and learn from the best faculty in the country in<br> that particular subject. This strengthens the fundamentals of the student in the course</li>
            <li>Gives the students the opportunities to explore new areas of interest – which are not<br> possible in a regular college environment.</li>
            <li>Faculty can use these for career progression.</li>
            <li>The audience in a MOOC includes students spanning the length and breadth of India and<br> a small fraction of foreign students. This mix of peer groups gives the students a chance<br> to assess where they stand with respect to this group of learners.</li>
            <li>These courses also bring out the self-learning initiative of the students – where their own<br> motivation is what drives them to complete the course and not external compulsions.<br> This fosters the habit of keeping oneself updated always by means of self-study.</li>
            <li>The certificates issued bear the stamp of the institute offering the course and hence are<br> valuable additions when the students apply for jobs.</li>
            <li>Companies can also recruit from this pool of candidates with specialized skills.</li>

            <p>Currently, NPTEL is working towards bringing in an industry perspective 
              to its<br> technically rich courses which led to the inception of NPTEL 
              INDUSTRY<br> ASSOCIATE (NIA). NPTEL aims to partner with organisations in a 
              mutually<br> beneficial manner by offering courses to train the freshers in 
              the companies and<br> to cross-skill and up-skill the existing workforce. 
              Other ways in which<br> companies partner with NPTEL is to have their senior 
              management give live<br> talks on current technology trends, conduct mock 
              interviews for NPTEL<br> learners, run short term workshops, and also provide 
              CSR support to the<br> various initiatives that are not supported by MoE

            <li><b>GATE preparation portal:</b>NPTEL is developing a subsite to help 
              students prepare for GATE exams based on NPTEL<br> courses. This will include
               detailed video solutions to questions in previous GATE papers, mock tests 
               for learners<br> and maybe live sessions for learners with experts who can 
               help clarify doubts. https://gate.nptel.ac.in/</li>
            <li><b>Support to attend technical conferences:</b> NPTEL will sponsor the 
              cost of travel and conference registration fees<br> for Coordinators of 
              different Local Chapters (colleges who partner with NPTEL), if the 
              required conditions are met.<br> This will help them upgrade and be abreast 
              of the latest developments in the field which will benefit the students<br> 
              they are teaching. Read More</li>
